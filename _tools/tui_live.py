"""A real ANSI terminal player for the world.execute(me); PV - characters, not pixels.

    终端实时版 by 林原林海. The film, its 97 shots and every number this player reads are
    MisakaZentai's open-source rebuild (MIT); the terminal player - this file, `film_panels.py`,
    `her_glyphs.py`, `pv_audio.py`, `dsh_text.py`, `tui_shot.py` - is by 林原林海. Both halves of
    the attribution chain are printed by `--credits`, and are also in the package README.

The film itself is raster: tuikit.py draws monospace glyphs onto a 1280x720 PIL canvas
and ffmpeg turns the frames into an mp4. That picture cannot be squeezed into a terminal
(1280x720 = 921,600 pixels against roughly 200x55 = 11,000 cells), so this does not try.
Instead it rebuilds the parts of the film that were always data - as genuine terminal output,
from the film's own numbers:

    wave_rms_1ms.npy       211,912 float32, one per millisecond of the real song
    audio_features.json    loud / 7 bands / kick / flux / cent, 10,180 rows
    word_timeline.json     98 lines, word by word, from build.py lyrics
    film_panels.py         everything below, read back out of the film's own source

the header waveform, the lyric band and the token chips, the seven feature bands, her pane
(the same Sobel-into-glyphs algorithm the film uses, at terminal resolution) and the ops
ticker all run the whole way through. On top of that the player shows the drawings that were
always terminal text anyway, on the shots that own them:

    shot_power, shot_protection   the POST log, printing at the film's own times (0.84 s +)
    shot_begin_sim                the 3-2-1 countdown, then RUN / simulation: running
    shot_corpus                   the corpus river, 20 rows walking sec_intro.CORPUS
    shot_losscurve                train/loss dot chart, lr schedule, tokens-seen counter
    shot_blind                    the 12x12 causal mask, sweeping from beat 103
    shot_memory_ls, shot_erase    ls -la ~/memory/you/, the eight files she digs up
    shot_exec_hit (x13)           the five EXECUTION layouts - wordmark, kill log,
                                  EXECUTE-in-EXECUTE, ps -ef, EPERM - with the red beat flash
    shot_count                    Ein, dos, trois, ne, fem, liu - digits, languages, mixing
    shot_last_execution,          one red word over the sea floor, then black and one lit cell that
      shot_black                  types 在吗？ into the prompt. Nobody answers.

Everything on screen is a character cell with a truecolor fg/bg; only cells that changed
since the last frame are written, so it holds frame rate in a real terminal.

It plays the song too. The picture follows the music rather than a wall clock: `pv_audio` drives
Windows' own MCI device from `input/song.mp3` - the same 320 kbps track the mp4 was muxed from -
and each frame nudges the clock onto `MCI position - 0.25 s`, the offset the decoder runs ahead of
the speaker. Nothing to install, no second copy of the audio on disk.

    python _tools/tui_live.py                 play in the current terminal, with sound
    python _tools/tui_live.py --start 147     open at 02:27
    python _tools/tui_live.py --no-audio      silent (also what --once/--dump/--shots do)
    python _tools/tui_live.py --once 147      write one frame to stdout and exit
    python _tools/tui_live.py --dump 6        six frames as plain text (no colour)
    python _tools/tui_live.py --shots         print the film's shot table with its ops
    python _tools/tui_live.py --credits       print both attribution lines (film and player)

# tuikit.py:468-476 is the film's last pass over every frame: `lighter(img, prev * 0.42)` (the frame
# keeps whatever the previous frame had, at 42 %, so anything that leaves an area leaves a ghost for
# about three frames), a Gaussian bloom, `scanlines()` (every third pixel row, 22 % black) and
# `vignette()` (an ellipse - nothing at the centre, 91 % black in a corner, and the bottom band is
# lifted so the lyric stays readable, tuikit.py:454-465). A terminal has no sub-cell control, so:
#
#   trail      a glyph the previous frame held is kept at 42 % where nothing is drawn now, decaying
#   scanlines  every third character row at 86 %
#   vignette   the film's own ellipse, evaluated once per resize. A static field costs nothing in a
#              diffing renderer; one that moved every frame would repaint the whole screen
#   bloom      no analogue - a glyph cannot glow, and the nearest thing (brightening the ink) is
#              what the ramps are already doing.
#
# And the cuts. kit.py:348-395 is the film's main cut mechanism: each cell of the region switches
# from the old picture to the new one when its *own* time comes, and shows a decoding glyph while it
# does. `radial` / `sweep` / `inward` (kit.py:398-414) are the delay fields, and 61 of the film's 96
# cuts use them (39 radial, 12 inward, 11 sweep, cut classes in continuity_full_v2/cuts.py). The
# film's cell is 8x16 px of a 1280x720 pane; one terminal cell stands in for one of those.
